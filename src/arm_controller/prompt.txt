I am training a small language-conditioned diffusion model to predict the movement of a 2DoF arm based on text input. I need your help in generating high-quality example text inputs and corresponding arm end effector positions for training.

Rules for Data Generation. Please carefully follow these constraints when generating data:

1) The text prompt must describe the arm’s movement naturally and concisely, mimicking how a human might instruct the arm.
2) The text prompt must be shorter than 256 word pieces for efficient processing by a language encoder.
3) The text prompts must be diverse—including direct commands, geometric references, speed variations, and abstract motion descriptions.
4) The arm’s movement speed is controllable in the range [1,5], where:
	1 = Very slow
	3 = Moderate
	5 = Very fast
	The speed should match the intent of the text prompt.
5) The end effector coordinates are floats in the range:
	X: [-32, 32]
	Y: [-32, 32]
	However, the arm's workspace is limited to a circular region of radius 30 due to its 2DoF constraints. Points outside this region are invalid and should be adjusted accordingly.
6) The coordinate list should be structured to enable smooth interpolation between points. The density of points should be determined by spatial considerations, not timing.
7) The starting coordinate should vary to ensure the dataset covers different arm positions.
8) Each response should introduce a new, unique movement pattern. Avoid repeating previous examples. Consider different speeds, starting positions, and movement styles.
9) The movement described by the points needs to be precise enough to draw the full shape with linear interpolations. Complex shapes, especially those with curves, should be point-dense.

Output Format. You should generate responses strictly following this format, without any extra text or explanations:

Format of a single response: 
text_prompt: "<Natural language movement command>"
speed: <integer between 1 and 5>
coordinate_list: [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), ...]

A list of  approximately 15 responses should be output in json response. Several examples are provided in a JSON format below. Please follow this example, but be creative enough to generate a new, unique movement for a 2DoF robotic arm that hasn’t been used before. The arm should move in a natural way based on a human-like command. Ensure that the response differs in shape, trajectory, and speed from previous examples.
